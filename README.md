## Description

**YourOra** - Build the social layer of everyday effort. YourOra turns each workout or positive habit into a proud, judgment-free daily post that fuels accountability via streaks and community.

### **Vision & Core Concept**
YourOra is a streak-driven, fitness-first social app that leverages the power of social accountability and social proof to keep users engaged and consistent. By posting daily proof of effort, users not only track their personal progress but also contribute to a collective environment of positive action.

### **Key Principles**
- **Effort > Aesthetics:** We reward showing up, not perfection. A quick selfie after a walk or a screenshot of a finished workout is more valuable than a heavily edited gym photo.
- **Kind Accountability:** Our community thrives on friendly nudges and genuine support. We're a cheer squad, not a competition.
- **Daily Ritual:** The core loop is designed to be completed in less than 30 seconds. It's about a quick, satisfying check-in that fits seamlessly into your day.
- **Privacy-First:** Users have granular control over who sees their posts and personal information.
- **Zero Friction:** The posting flow is a one-tap process—camera → post → streak—making it incredibly simple to maintain consistency.

### **Target Users**
- **Everyday Movers:** Simple daily activities like walks, home workouts, or yoga
- **Lifestyle Changers:** Weight-loss or habit-building journeys, needing supportive community
- **Beginner to Intermediate Gym-Goers:** Building habits, wanting to share progress without pressure
- **Status Trackers:** Love streaks, badges, progress bars. Motivated by visual representation of effort

Built entirely using React Native, this project provides a seamless, intuitive, and visually appealing mobile experience with modern animations to enhance user interactions and engagement.
