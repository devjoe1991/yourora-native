## Your Ora Design System

Your Ora's design system is built to reflect the concept of a personal aura: ethereal, calming, and full of life. It's modern, minimalistic, and elegant, prioritizing a clean user experience that feels both intuitive and uplifting.

### **Color Palette**

The color palette is inspired by natural auras, combining calming neutrals with vibrant, life-affirming accents.

* **Aura White:** `#F5F5F5` - The primary background color. It provides a clean, breathable canvas that feels light and open.
* **Vapor Cream:** `#FFFDD0` - A soft, off-white used for cards, containers, and highlights. It adds warmth and a subtle tactile feel.
* **Spirit Blue:** `#0077B6` - The main accent color. It represents clarity, focus, and serenity. Use it for primary calls-to-action (CTAs), key icons, and headers.
* **Ember Green:** `#00BFA5` - A secondary accent color. It symbolizes growth, health, and vitality. Use it for "streak" counters, success messages, and positive notifications.
* **Shadow Gray:** `#333333` - A deep, near-black for all body text and secondary labels. It provides excellent readability against the light backgrounds.

### **Typography**

Typography is simple, clean, and highly readable, designed to keep the focus on user content and progress.

* **Primary Font:** **Poppins** (Sans-Serif).
    * **Headlines (H1, H2):** Bold or SemiBold for strong, clear titles.
    * **Body Text:** Regular for a clean, professional look.
    * **Streaks & Stats:** Use a slightly heavier weight (e.g., Medium) to give numerical data more visual importance.

### **User Interface Components**

All components are designed to feel spacious and uncluttered, with rounded corners to soften the overall aesthetic.

#### **Buttons**

* **Primary Button:** Filled with **Spirit Blue** with white text. Slightly rounded corners.
* **Secondary Button:** Outline in **Spirit Blue** with **Spirit Blue** text.
* **Positive Action Button:** Filled with **Ember Green** with white text. Used for "post streak" or "celebrate" actions.

#### **Cards & Containers**

* **Background:** **Vapor Cream**
* **Borders:** Subtle 1px border in a lighter shade of **Shadow Gray** to separate elements without feeling heavy.
* **Corners:** All cards and containers have a 10px `border-radius` to create a soft, approachable feel.

#### **Icons**

Icons are minimalistic, using simple, clean lines.

* **Color:** Typically **Shadow Gray** for clarity, with **Spirit Blue** or **Ember Green** used for active states or notifications.

### **Imagery & Graphics**

* **Style:** Clean, minimalistic, and often abstract.
* **Aura Visuals:** Subtle, glowing gradients in **Spirit Blue** and **Ember Green** can be used as background effects or in hero sections to reinforce the app's core theme.
* **User Avatars:** Circular with a thin, glowing border that changes color based on the user's current streak level or chosen "aura" color.
