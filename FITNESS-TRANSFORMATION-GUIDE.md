## 📊 Content Types Transformation

  exercise: "push_ups",
  sets: 3,

}
```

## 🔥 Streak-Based Social Feed System

### **Core Concept: "Streak Circles"**
Transform the traditional stories section into a dynamic, streak-based social feed where users see content from others on the same fitness journey level.

### **How It Works**
```javascript
// Streak Level System
const streakLevels = {
  1: "Newcomer",      // 1-7 days
  2: "Rising",        // 8-14 days  
  3: "Committed",     // 15-30 days
  4: "Dedicated",     // 31-60 days
  5: "Elite",         // 61-100 days
  6: "Legendary",     // 100+ days
  7: "Master"         // 365+ days
}
```

### **Feed Algorithm**
- **Day 1-7:** See content from other newcomers starting their journey
- **Day 8-14:** Connect with "Rising" users building momentum
- **Day 15-30:** Join the "Committed" community
- **Day 31+:** Access higher-level feeds with advanced users

### **Social Dynamics**
- **Peer Motivation:** See people at your exact level succeeding
- **Realistic Goals:** Content from people with similar experience
- **Gradual Progression:** Unlock new communities as you grow
- **Mentorship Opportunities:** Higher-level users can inspire lower levels

### **Visual Design (Keeping Your Current Layout)**
- **Same Circular Avatar Design:** Keep the exact same circular profile layout you have
- **Streak Level Indicators:** Add subtle **Ember Green** border glow around avatars based on streak level
- **Level Badges:** Small **Spirit Blue** number badge in corner of each avatar (1-7)
- **Status Icons:** Keep the emoji reactions (like the sad face) but make them fitness-related
- **Background:** Maintain your current dark background with subtle patterns
- **Navigation:** Keep "Feed" and "Video" tabs at bottom

### **User Experience**
1. **Daily Check-in:** Complete workout to maintain streak
2. **Feed Update:** See new content from your streak level community
3. **Level Up:** Unlock next streak level and new community
4. **Celebration:** Special animations and rewards for milestones

### **Implementation with Your Current Design**

#### **What Stays the Same:**
- ✅ **Circular Avatar Layout:** Keep the exact same 3-circle horizontal layout
- ✅ **Background Design:** Maintain your dark background with subtle patterns
- ✅ **Navigation Tabs:** Keep "Feed" and "Video" at the bottom
- ✅ **Overall Spacing:** Same positioning and proportions

#### **What Changes:**
- **Circular Content:** Show **streak scores** (numbers) instead of profile pictures
- **Streak Numbers:** Large, bold numbers in the center of each circle (e.g., "15", "23", "45")
- **Border Effects:** Add **Ember Green** glow around circles based on streak level
- **Level Indicators:** Color-coded circles - different colors for different streak levels
- **Status Icons:** Replace emoji reactions with fitness status (💪 for workout complete, 🔥 for streak, etc.)

#### **Technical Implementation**
```javascript
// Streak-based feed filtering for your current avatar component
const getStreakFeed = (userStreakLevel) => {
  return posts.filter(post => 
    post.author.streakLevel === userStreakLevel ||
    post.author.streakLevel === userStreakLevel + 1 // Show next level for motivation
  );
};

// Streak level calculation
const calculateStreakLevel = (streakDays) => {
  if (streakDays <= 7) return 1;      // Newcomer
  if (streakDays <= 14) return 2;     // Rising
  if (streakDays <= 30) return 3;     // Committed
  if (streakDays <= 60) return 4;     // Dedicated
  if (streakDays <= 100) return 5;    // Elite
  if (streakDays <= 365) return 6;    // Legendary
  return 7;                           // Master
};

// Streak Score Circle component
const StreakScoreCircle = ({ streakDays, streakLevel, isCurrentUser }) => {
  const getCircleColor = (level) => {
    switch(level) {
      case 1: return '#FF6B6B';      // Newcomer - Red
      case 2: return '#4ECDC4';      // Rising - Teal  
      case 3: return '#45B7D1';      // Committed - Blue
      case 4: return '#96CEB4';      // Dedicated - Green
      case 5: return '#FFEAA7';      // Elite - Yellow
      case 6: return '#DDA0DD';      // Legendary - Purple
      case 7: return '#FFD700';      // Master - Gold
      default: return '#333333';
    }
  };

  return (
    <View style={styles.streakCircleContainer}>
      <View style={[
        styles.streakCircle, 
        { 
          backgroundColor: getCircleColor(streakLevel),
          borderColor: isCurrentUser ? '#00BFA5' : 'transparent',
          borderWidth: isCurrentUser ? 3 : 0
        }
      ]}>
        <Text style={styles.streakNumber}>{streakDays}</Text>
      </View>
      <Text style={styles.streakLabel}>
        {isCurrentUser ? 'You' : 'Day'}
      </Text>
    </View>
  );
};
```

## 🔥 Streak Score Circles - Visual Concept

### **How It Works:**
Instead of profile pictures, each circle shows a **streak score number**:

```
Your current streak: Day 15 (Level 3 - "Committed")
┌─────────┐ ┌─────────┐ ┌─────────┐
│   15    │ │   18    │ │   25    │
│  (You)  │ │ (Same)  │ │ (Next)  │
└─────────┘ └─────────┘ └─────────┘
   Blue       Blue        Green
```

### **Color-Coded Streak Levels:**
- **🔴 Red (1-7 days):** Newcomer
- **🟢 Teal (8-14 days):** Rising  
- **🔵 Blue (15-30 days):** Committed
- **🟢 Green (31-60 days):** Dedicated
- **🟡 Yellow (61-100 days):** Elite
- **🟣 Purple (101-365 days):** Legendary
- **🟠 Gold (365+ days):** Master

### **User Experience:**
1. **Left Circle:** Your current streak score (highlighted with **Ember Green** border)
2. **Middle Circle:** Someone else on the same streak level as you
3. **Right Circle:** Someone on the next streak level (motivation)

### **Feed Unlocking System:**
- **Tap Circle 1 (Your Score):** See your personal workout feed and progress
- **Tap Circle 2 (Same Level):** Unlock feed from people on the same streak level as you
- **Tap Circle 3 (Next Level):** Preview feed from people on the next streak level (motivation)
- **Daily Progression:** As your streak increases, new circles unlock with higher-level content

### **Feed Unlocking Mechanism:**
```javascript
// Example: User on Day 15 (Level 3 - "Committed")
const userStreak = 15;
const userLevel = 3;

// Available feeds based on streak score:
const availableFeeds = {
  personal: {
    streak: userStreak,
    content: "Your workout logs, progress photos, personal notes"
  },
  sameLevel: {
    streakRange: "15-30 days", // Level 3 range
    content: "Workouts from other 'Committed' users",
    unlocked: true
  },
  nextLevel: {
    streakRange: "31-60 days", // Level 4 range  
    content: "Preview of 'Dedicated' user content",
    unlocked: true,
    preview: true // Limited access
  },
  higherLevels: {
    streakRange: "61+ days",
    content: "Locked until you reach Level 5",
    unlocked: false
  }
};
```

### **Progressive Unlocking:**
- **Day 1-7:** Only see "Newcomer" feeds
- **Day 8-14:** Unlock "Rising" feeds + preview "Committed"
- **Day 15-30:** Unlock "Committed" feeds + preview "Dedicated"
- **Day 31+:** Unlock "Dedicated" feeds + preview "Elite"
- **And so on...**

### **Benefits:**
- **Instant Recognition:** See your progress at a glance
- **Peer Motivation:** Compare with others at your level
- **Goal Setting:** See what the next level looks like
- **Gamification:** Visual progress tracking
- **Community Building:** Connect with people on the same journey
- **Motivation:** Preview higher levels to stay motivated
