# YourOra App Development Rules

## Core Principles

### 1. **No Unnecessary Over-Complication**
- Keep solutions simple and straightforward
- Avoid complex patterns when simple ones work
- Prefer readable, maintainable code over clever solutions
- Don't add features that aren't explicitly requested

### 2. **No Over-Engineering**
- Build only what's needed for the current task
- Avoid premature optimization
- Don't create abstractions until they're actually needed
- Keep components focused and single-purpose

### 3. **Always Read Documentation First**
- **MANDATORY**: Read through all relevant docs files before starting any task
- Understand the project structure and existing patterns
- Check implementation guides and theme guidelines
- Review existing components to maintain consistency
- Follow established patterns and conventions
