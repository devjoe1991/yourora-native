What I Changed

I modified the AuthNavigation.js file to always show the main app instead of checking authentication status. Now the app will:
✅ Skip the login/signup screens completely
✅ Go directly to the main app (SignedInStack)
✅ Show the bottom tab navigation with Home, Explore, Reels, and Messages

The Change
// Before: Checked authentication status
return <>{authCtx.isAuthenticated ? <SignedInStack /> : <SignedOutStack />}</>

// After: Always show main app
return <SignedInStack />;

What You'll See Now

When you run the app, it will:
Skip the login/signup screens
Go straight to the main social media interface
Show the bottom tab bar with Home, Explore, Reels, and Messages
Allow you to test all the app features without authentication
The app should now load directly into the main interface! You can test all the features like viewing posts, stories, reels, etc. without needing to sign up or log in.

When you're ready to re-enable authentication later, just uncomment the original code and comment out the bypass line.
