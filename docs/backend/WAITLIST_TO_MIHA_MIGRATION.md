# Waitlist to Miha App - Complete Data Flow Migration

## 🎯 **OVERVIEW: FROM WAITLIST TO FULL APP**

This document shows how your existing waitlist backend seamlessly transitions into the full Miha social fitness app, preserving all user data and building upon the existing Supabase infrastructure.

---

## 📊 **CURRENT WAITLIST STRUCTURE**

### **Existing Tables (Keep These)**
```sql
-- Your waitlist already has:
waitlist (
  id, email, first_name, last_name, 
  fitness_goal, other_fitness_goal, inserted_at
)

-- Plus Supabase Auth:
auth.users (id, email, created_at, etc.)
```

### **Existing Data Flow**
1. **Stage 1**: User submits email → `waitlist` table
2. **Stage 2**: User completes profile → `waitlist` table updated
3. **Result**: Rich user data ready for app launch

---

## 🔄 **MIGRATION STRATEGY: WAITLIST → MIHA APP**

### **Phase 1: Preserve Waitlist Data**
```sql
-- Keep waitlist table as-is for historical data
-- This becomes your "early adopters" list
-- Use for marketing and user onboarding
```

### **Phase 2: Create Miha App Tables**
```sql
-- Add these new tables for full app functionality:

-- User profiles (enhanced from waitlist data)
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS profiles (
  id UUID REFERENCES auth.users(id) PRIMARY KEY,
  email TEXT UNIQUE NOT NULL,
  full_name TEXT,
  avatar_url TEXT,
  bio TEXT,
  timezone TEXT DEFAULT 'UTC',
  fitness_goal fitness_goal_type, -- Reuse your enum!
  other_fitness_goal TEXT,
  created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
  updated_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- Social features
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS posts (
  id UUID DEFAULT gen_random_uuid() PRIMARY KEY,
  user_id UUID REFERENCES profiles(id) NOT NULL,
  media_url TEXT,
  caption TEXT,
  post_type TEXT DEFAULT 'post',
  streak_day INTEGER,
  created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW()
);

CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS streaks (
  user_id UUID REFERENCES profiles(id) PRIMARY KEY,
  current_streak INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
  longest_streak INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
  last_posted_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE
);

CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS follows (
  follower_id UUID REFERENCES profiles(id),
  following_id UUID REFERENCES profiles(id),
  created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
  PRIMARY KEY (follower_id, following_id)
);

CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS post_likes (
  post_id UUID REFERENCES posts(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  user_id UUID REFERENCES profiles(id),
  emoji_type TEXT DEFAULT '❤️',
  created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
  PRIMARY KEY (post_id, user_id)
);

CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS comments (
  id UUID DEFAULT gen_random_uuid() PRIMARY KEY,
  post_id UUID REFERENCES posts(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  user_id UUID REFERENCES profiles(id),
  text TEXT NOT NULL,
  created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW()
);

CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS notifications (
  id UUID DEFAULT gen_random_uuid() PRIMARY KEY,
  user_id UUID REFERENCES profiles(id),
  type TEXT NOT NULL,
  message TEXT NOT NULL,
  read_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE,
  created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW()
);

CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS messages (
  id UUID DEFAULT gen_random_uuid() PRIMARY KEY,
  sender_id UUID REFERENCES profiles(id),
  receiver_id UUID REFERENCES profiles(id),
  content TEXT NOT NULL,
  created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW()
);

CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS user_roles (
  user_id UUID REFERENCES profiles(id) PRIMARY KEY,
  role TEXT DEFAULT 'user',
  status TEXT DEFAULT 'active',
  created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

## 🔄 **USER MIGRATION FLOW**

### **Step 1: Waitlist User Signs Up for App**
```typescript
// When waitlist user downloads the app and signs up:

const migrateWaitlistUser = async (email: string, password: string) => {
  try {
    // 1. Create auth user
    const { data: authData, error: authError } = await supabase.auth.signUp({
      email,
      password
    })
    
    if (authError) throw authError
    
    // 2. Get waitlist data
    const { data: waitlistData, error: waitlistError } = await supabase
      .from('waitlist')
      .select('*')
      .eq('email', email)
      .single()
    
    if (waitlistError) throw waitlistError
    
    // 3. Create profile with waitlist data
    const { data: profileData, error: profileError } = await supabase
      .from('profiles')
      .insert([{
        id: authData.user.id,
        email: waitlistData.email,
        full_name: `${waitlistData.first_name} ${waitlistData.last_name}`,
        fitness_goal: waitlistData.fitness_goal,
        other_fitness_goal: waitlistData.other_fitness_goal,
        bio: `Ready to start my ${waitlistData.fitness_goal} journey!`
      }])
    
    if (profileError) throw profileError
    
    return { success: true, user: profileData }
  } catch (error) {
    return { success: false, error: error.message }
  }
}
```

### **Step 2: Pre-populate User Experience**
```typescript
// Use waitlist data to personalize the app experience:

const personalizeUserExperience = async (userId: string) => {
  const { data: profile } = await supabase
    .from('profiles')
    .select('fitness_goal, other_fitness_goal')
    .eq('id', userId)
    .single()
  
  // Customize feed based on fitness goal
  const feedQuery = supabase
    .from('posts')
    .select(`
      *,
      profiles!posts_user_id_fkey(*),
      post_likes(*)
    `)
    .order('created_at', { ascending: false })
  
  // Add fitness goal filtering
  if (profile.fitness_goal) {
    // Show posts from users with similar goals
    // This would require additional logic based on your feed algorithm
  }
  
  return feedQuery
}
```

## 📱 **COMPONENT INTEGRATION WITH WAITLIST DATA**

### **Enhanced LoginScreen.js**
```typescript
// Check if user exists in waitlist
const checkWaitlistStatus = async (email: string) => {
  const { data, error } = await supabase
    .from('waitlist')
    .select('*')
    .eq('email', email)
    .single()
  
  if (data) {
    // User is from waitlist - show special onboarding
    return { isWaitlistUser: true, waitlistData: data }
  }
  
  return { isWaitlistUser: false }
}
```

### **Enhanced SignupScreen.js**
```typescript
// Pre-fill signup form with waitlist data
const prefillFromWaitlist = async (email: string) => {
  const { data } = await supabase
    .from('waitlist')
    .select('first_name, last_name, fitness_goal')
    .eq('email', email)
    .single()
  
  if (data) {
    return {
      firstName: data.first_name,
      lastName: data.last_name,
      fitnessGoal: data.fitness_goal
    }
  }
  
  return null
}
```

### **Enhanced Homescreen.js**
```typescript
// Personalized feed based on waitlist fitness goals
const getPersonalizedFeed = async (userId: string) => {
  // Get user's fitness goal from profile
  const { data: profile } = await supabase
    .from('profiles')
    .select('fitness_goal')
    .eq('id', userId)
    .single()
  
  // Build feed query with fitness goal context
  const feedQuery = supabase
    .from('posts')
    .select(`
      *,
      profiles!posts_user_id_fkey(*),
      post_likes(*),
      comments(*)
    `)
    .order('created_at', { ascending: false })
  
  // Add fitness goal filtering logic here
  return feedQuery
}
```

## 🎯 **MARKETING & USER ONBOARDING**

### **Waitlist User Onboarding Flow**
```typescript
// Special onboarding for waitlist users
const waitlistUserOnboarding = async (userId: string) => {
  // 1. Get their original waitlist data
  const { data: waitlistData } = await supabase
    .from('waitlist')
    .select('*')
    .eq('email', userEmail)
    .single()
  
  // 2. Show personalized welcome message
  const welcomeMessage = `Welcome back! We remember you wanted to focus on ${waitlistData.fitness_goal}. Let's get started!`
  
  // 3. Pre-populate their first post suggestion
  const suggestedPost = `Day 1 of my ${waitlistData.fitness_goal} journey! 💪`
  
  // 4. Connect them with users who have similar goals
  const similarUsers = await supabase
    .from('profiles')
    .select('*')
    .eq('fitness_goal', waitlistData.fitness_goal)
    .limit(5)
  
  return {
    welcomeMessage,
    suggestedPost,
    similarUsers
  }
}
```

### **Email Marketing Integration**
```typescript
// Send targeted emails to waitlist users
const notifyWaitlistUsers = async () => {
  const { data: waitlistUsers } = await supabase
    .from('waitlist')
    .select('email, first_name, fitness_goal')
    .is('first_name', null) // Users who only submitted email
  
  // Send personalized app launch emails
  for (const user of waitlistUsers) {
    await sendEmail({
      to: user.email,
      subject: `Miha is here! Ready to start your ${user.fitness_goal} journey?`,
      template: 'app-launch',
      data: {
        firstName: user.first_name,
        fitnessGoal: user.fitness_goal
      }
    })
  }
}
```

  (COUNT(p.id) * 100.0 / COUNT(*)) as conversion_rate
FROM waitlist w
LEFT JOIN profiles p ON w.email = p.email;
```

### **User Engagement by Fitness Goal**
```sql
-- See which fitness goals drive most engagement
SELECT 
  fitness_goal,
  COUNT(*) as user_count,
  AVG(current_streak) as avg_streak,
