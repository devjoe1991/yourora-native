# Why "Your Ora" Tab Should Replace Video Tab

## 🎯 **The Core Problem**

Your current Video tab is **misaligned** with Miha's core value proposition. You're a **fitness streak app**, not a video consumption platform. Users come to Miha to track progress, not watch videos.

---

## 💡 **The Solution: "Your Ora" Tab**

Replace the Video tab with a personalized "Your Ora" section that puts **the user's progress front and center**.

---

## 🚀 **Why This Is A Brilliant Strategic Move**

### **1. Aligns With Your Core Business**
- **Miha = Fitness Streaks** - "Your Ora" tab reinforces this
- **Video Tab = Generic Social** - Doesn't differentiate you from Instagram/TikTok
- **Result**: Users understand your value proposition immediately

### **2. Eliminates Redundancy**
- **Videos already exist** in your main feed
- **Separate video tab** = unnecessary duplication
- **"Your Ora" tab** = unique value that can't be found elsewhere
- **Result**: Cleaner, more focused user experience

### **3. Increases User Engagement**
- **Video consumption** = passive, one-way interaction
- **Progress tracking** = active, personal investment
- **Users return** to check their progress, not to watch random videos
- **Result**: Higher retention and daily active users

### **4. Drives Your Core Metrics**
- **Streak maintenance** - Users see their progress daily
- **Goal completion** - Visual progress motivates action
- **Social sharing** - Users share achievements, not videos
- **Result**: Better user outcomes = better business outcomes

### **5. Differentiates From Competitors**
- **Instagram** = Photo/video sharing
- **TikTok** = Video entertainment
- **Miha** = Personal fitness progress tracking
- **Result**: Clear positioning in the market
