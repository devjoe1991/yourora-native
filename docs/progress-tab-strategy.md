# "Your Ora" Tab Strategy - Replacing Video Tab

## ðŸŽ¯ **Strategic Overview**

### **Why Replace Video Tab?**
The current Video tab doesn't align with Miha's core value proposition of streak-based fitness tracking and social accountability. Replacing it with a comprehensive "Your Ora" tab (personalized progress section) will:

- **Strengthen core functionality** - Focus on what users actually need
- **Increase user engagement** - Progress tracking is more motivating than video consumption
- **Improve retention** - Users stay engaged with their personal progress
- **Align with fitness goals** - Progress tracking is essential for fitness apps
- **Reduce cognitive load** - One less tab to navigate, more focused experience
- **Eliminate redundancy** - Video content already appears in the main feed, making a separate video tab unnecessary

## ðŸ“Š **Data Strategy**

### **Core Metrics to Track:**
```javascript
const progressMetrics = {
  // Streak Data
  currentStreak: number,
  longestStreak: number,
  streakStartDate: date,
  
  // Goal Data
  dailyGoals: {
    workouts: { target: 1, completed: 1 },
    minutes: { target: 30, completed: 25 },
    steps: { target: 10000, completed: 8500 }
  },
  
  // Weekly Data
  weeklyStats: {
    workouts: number,
    totalMinutes: number,
    goalsCompleted: number,
    averageStreak: number
  },
  
  // Monthly Data
  monthlyStats: {
    workouts: number,
    personalRecords: number,
    streakDays: number,
    achievements: number
  },
  
  // Achievements
  achievements: [
    {
      id: string,
      title: string,
      description: string,
      earned: boolean,
      dateEarned: date,
      icon: string
    }
